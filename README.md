# Public Good-Faith Security Disclosures

I am a security researcher exposing systemic vulnerabilities in the systems that shape our lives.
Repeated institutional failures have made private disclosure a barrier to public safety, not a solution.

My intent is clear: reveal the truth about what puts you at risk, so accountability is unavoidable.
Our children deserve transparency... not comfortable illusions.

<summary><strong>My Covenant: What I Guarantee and What I Cannot </strong></summary>

<br>

**What I guarantee:**
- Disclosures made in absolute good faith
- Vulnerabilities reported are real and consequential
- My intent is unwavering: public safety over institutional comfort
- I will engage honestly with technical questions and verification

**What I cannot guarantee:**
- Perfect documentation... I work alone, with limited resources
- Flawless technical presentation... I am human and fallible
- Universal agreement on severity or exploitability

> **Imperfect documentation of a real vulnerability is infinitely more valuable than perfect silence.**

Researchers, verify my findings. Correct my errors. Debate my severity assessments...  
But do not dismiss legitimate concerns because the messenger is imperfect.

The standard is not perfection... the standard is good faith. That is what I offer, without reservation.

<summary><strong>About These Disclosures </strong></summary>

<br>

These reports are technical... not everyone will grasp every detail, and that’s fine.  
What matters is the intent: to expose what puts you at risk.

There will be imperfections, incomplete documentation, debate on technical points...  
This does not diminish their validity or importance.

> You don’t need to understand the code... you need to understand the consequence. 
> You don’t need to parse the architecture... you need to recognize the risk.
> You don’t need to know the mechanism... you need to know you deserve better.

<summary><strong>My Principles </strong></summary>

<br>

**Light overcomes darkness.**  
What’s hidden gets weaponized. What’s revealed can be fixed.

**Truth serves the powerless.**  
Secrecy is the architecture of institutional immunity. Transparency is the foundation of public safety.

**We are each other's keepers.**  
When the powerful abdicate responsibility, we must care for each other.

**Imperfection does not negate truth.**  
My methods and documentation may be flawed... but the vulnerabilities are real, and your right to know is absolute.

> "When trust fails, all we have left is each other."

<summary><strong>Why I Walk This Path </strong></summary>

<br>

I have borne witness to a pattern that must not be ignored:

Institutions, when confronted with evidence of failure, do not reform... they obscure. 
They prioritize reputation over remedy.

I have followed process. I have waited for accountability. I have learned this...  
The systems that should protect us have become mechanisms for our exploitation.

- **Report a vulnerability** ... Silence  
- **Escalate concern** ... Bureaucratic deflection  
- **Demand action** ... Institutional self-preservation

When entrusted institutions opt for survival over public protection, disclosure is no longer a choice... it is the only ethical response.

This isn't rebellion...  
This is remembering what we owe to each other when those in power forget.

## A Moral Imperative: A Parent's Sacred Duty 


Everything I do, I do for my child.  
Not as metaphor. Not as rhetoric. As operational reality.

In the digital age, cybersecurity *is* child safety.  
The vulnerability I expose today is the attack our children face tomorrow... through their schools, their hospitals, their identities, their future.

Consider what's at stake:
- Every unpatched system: a door left unlocked in their world
- Every concealed flaw: a trap set for them
- Every tolerated institutional failure: a lesson we teach them about what to accept

**Every broken system we leave behind is a danger we actively choose for them.**

I have no platform. No backing. Limited resources.

But I possess something no institution can extinguish:  
> **An unshakeable love that turns security research from obligation into sacred duty.**

They can ignore my findings, question my methods, discredit my motives, highlight my imperfections...

**They cannot take away the love that drives me.**  
**They cannot unsound the bell that has already rung.**  
**They cannot erase what has now been witnessed.**

## A Final Truth 

We stand at a threshold...

Our systems—data, infrastructure, our children's futures—are catastrophically fragile in ways most will never see. 
Those who perceive the cracks face a choice...  
Look away, or bear witness.  
Preserve comfort, or pursue truth.  
Protect institutions, or protect people.

I choose to speak, not because I am perfect, but because I am here... and because silence would make me complicit.

> *What I offer here is an act of faith...*  
Not in institutions. Not in systems.  
**In us.**

In our capacity to face harsh truths and forge something better.  
In our power to choose accountability over comfort.  
Imperfect truth, offered in good faith, is worth more than perfect silence.

This is my offering...  
This is my covenant with the future...  
This is the inheritance I choose:  
A fracture in the façade...  
The beginning of something better.

*These disclosures are an act of love disguised as an act of defiance...  
They are imperfect, as all human works are...  
But they are offered in absolute good faith.*

**The choice... always... remains yours. Choose wisely.**
